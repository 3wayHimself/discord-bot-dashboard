# discord-bot-dashboard

Welcome to this new project.

In this project I develop a Dashboard Tool for developers which are using Discord.js for their bots. 

To run this project, run the command `npm start`.

When you want to change the port for listening, you can change it in the `config.json`.

Write your bot token from [the Discord Applications Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) into the `config.json` inside the property value of `token`.

In the `main.js` file, you can develop your bot!

IÂ´m using following npm packages:
```
- express
- jquery
- nodemon
- discord.js
```
